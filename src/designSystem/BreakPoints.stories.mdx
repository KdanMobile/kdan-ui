# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are the triggers in Kdan for how your layout responsive changes across device or viewport sizes.

<br />

## Available breakpoints

|   key    | value     |
| :--------: | :-------: |
| xs | 0px |
| sm | 425px |
| md | 768px |
| lg | 1024px |
| xl | 1440px |
| xxl | 1920px |

## CSS Media Queries
CSS media queries are the idiomatic approach to make your UI responsive.
The theme provides four styles helpers to do so:

* breakpoints.up(key): it's effectively `(min-width: [value]px)`.
* breakpoints.down(key): it's effectively `(max-width: [value]px)`.
* breakpoints.only(key): it's effectively `(min-width: [value]px) and (max-width: [value]px)`.
* breakpoints.between(key1, key2): it's effectively `(min-width: [value1]px) and (max-width: [value2]px)`.


## How to use?  

```styled.js
import { breakpoints } from "@kdanmobile/kdan-ui";

export const Wrapper = styled.div`
  @media ${breakpoints.down("md")} {
    // some styles...
  }
`;
```
